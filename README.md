AMUSE workspace
===============

This repository contains the configuration and playbooks to setup an AMUSE
install with ansible and vagrant or related technologies 
(like the SURF research cloud)

Getting started
---------------

Within this directory do something like:

```shell
vagrant up --provider=virtualbox
```

You will end up with a local virtual machine with AMUSE (amuse-framework 
for now) installed.
